# FEW 2.9 GraphQL Schemas and Types

<!-- > -->

Use a schema to define what your <br> GraphQL API can provide.

Strong typing of data allows for introspection.

<!-- > -->

## GraphQL ðŸ˜Ž and Express ðŸš‚

Today we will look at a simple example implementing GraphQL with Express. This is important since it puts GraphQL in a context that you have experience with.

<!-- > -->

## Class Learning Objectives/Competencies

1. Define a GraphQL Schema
1. Define a GraphQL Resolver
1. Use GraphQL Queries
1. Use GraphiQL

<!-- > -->

## Warm Up (5 mins)

**Discuss:**

GraphQL and SQL are both Query languages. How do they differ?

<!-- > -->

## Review 

- **Name three advantages of GraphQL over REST**

<!-- > -->

### GraphQL Queries 

**Use: https://graphql.org/swapi-graphql to answer these questions...**

**HINT:** If you get stuck, refer back to the [examples from the previous lesson](https://github.com/Make-School-Courses/FEW-2.9-Technical-Seminar/blob/master/Lessons/Lesson-1.md#nested-types) 

<!-- > -->

- Who is person 10?
  - name?
  - eyecolor?
  - height?

<!-- > -->

- What movies did they appear in? 
  - totalCount?
  - titles?

<!-- > -->

- What about vehicles?
  - totalCount?
  - names?

<!-- > -->

## GraphQL Schemas

<!-- > -->

A GraphQL **Schema** contains a set of Types that describe everything you can query from a service. 

<!-- > -->

Schemas are written in the GraphQL Schema language which is similar to the Query language. 

<!-- > -->

The SWAPI might define a person like this: 

```JS
type Person {
  name: String!
  eyeColor: String!
  ...
}
```

`name` is a field and `String` is it's type. `!` means the field is non-nullable (it will always return a value.)  

<!-- > -->

```JS
type Person {
  name: String!
  height: Int!
  eyecolor: String!
  films: [films!]!
}
```

You can use types like: `Int` and `[ ... ]` (a collection)

<!-- > -->

GraphQL supports: 

- `Int`: Integer
- `Float`: Decimal
- `String`: String
- `Boolean`: true or false
- `ID`: Special type that represents a unique value
- `[Type]`: Array of a type

<!-- > -->

The elements in a collection are typed and they will all be the same type. 

```JS
type MyType {
  favNumbers: [Int!]!
  favFoods: [String!]!
}
```

<!-- > -->

What about a Recipe type: 

```JS 
type Recipe {
  name: String! # Name is a string and must be there
  description: String # Description is a string and 
                      # might be missing
}
```

<small>(the `!` means a field _must_ have a value)</small>

<!-- > -->

A recipe might have a list of ingredients. 

```JS 
type Recipe {
  name: String!
  description: String
  ingredients: [String!]! # Must have a list of Strings
                          # and none of those strings can be 
                          # null
}
```

<!-- > -->

The Recipe type needs some more information: 

```JS
type Recipe {
  name: String!
  description: String
  ingredients: [String!]! 
  isSpicy: ?      # what type?
  isVegetarian: ? # what type?
}
```

<!-- > -->

```JS
type Recipe {
  name: String!
  description: String
  ingredients: [String!]! 
  isSpicy: Boolean!
  isVegetarian: Boolean!
}
```

<!-- > -->

### Enum

<!-- > -->

The GraphQL Schema language supports enumerations.

<!-- > -->

An **enumeration** is a list of set values.

<!-- > -->

The Recipe type needs some more information: 

```JS
enum MealType {
  breakfast
  lunch
  dinner
}

type Recipe {
  ...
  mealType: MealType! # Can only be breakfast, lunch or dinner
}
```

<small>(Validates and restricts values to one from the list)</small>

<!-- > -->

Write an enum that defines the diet type: 

- ominvore
- paleo
- vegitarian
- vegan

<!-- > -->

```JS
enum DietType {
  ominvore
  paleo
  vegitarian
  vegan
}

type Recipe {
  ...
  dietType: DietType! 
}
```

<!-- > -->

### Interface

<!-- > -->

An **interface** is a description or contract that describes types that conform to it. 

<!-- > -->

Imagine characters in the films could be humans or droids. 

```JS 
interface Character {
  name: String!
  films: [film!]!
}

type Human implements Character {
  name: String!
  eyeColor: String!
  films: [film!]!
}

type Droid implements Character {
  name: String!
  films: [film!]!
  primaryFunction: String!
}
```
<small>(Anything that implements the interface must include name and films)</small>

<!-- > -->

An interface is also a type. For example: 

```JS
type Film {
  title: String!
  cast: [Character!]! 
}
```

<small>(Here everyone in the cast is a Character but they might also be a Human or a Droid)</small>

<!-- > -->

## GraphQL and Express

<!-- > -->

Let's get started with GraphQL and Express. **The goal of this section is to create an Express server that implements GraphQL.**

<!-- > -->

### Setup

1. Create a new folder
1. Initialize a new npm project: `npm init -y`
1. Install dependancies: `npm install --save express express-graphql graphql`
1. Create a new file: `server.js`

<!-- > -->

**Important!** Be sure to include a `.gitignore`. You need to prevent uploading your `node_modules` folder to GradeScope!

**How to add a `.gitignore`:** https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/node

<!-- > -->

Edit `package.json`

```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "nodemon server.js"
  }
```

You can now run your project with: 

```bash
npm start
```

<!-- > -->

### GraphQL Express Server setup

Add the following to `server.js`. Import dependancies:

```JS
// Import dependancies
const express = require('express')
const { graphqlHTTP } = require('express-graphql')
const { buildSchema } = require('graphql')
```

<!-- > -->

Build a schema. Add the following to `server.js`.  

```JS
// Create a schema
const schema = buildSchema(`
type About {
  message: String!
}

type Query {
  getAbout: About
}`)
```

<small>(The schema is written in the GraphQL schema language, `buildSchema()` takes the schema as a string and returns a schema object)</small>

<!-- > -->

Define a resolver:

```JS
// Define a resolver
const root = {
  getAbout: () => {
    return { message: 'Hello World' }
  }
}
```

<small>(A **resolver** is a function that's responsible for returning the results of a query. *You might a say a resolver resolves a query.*)</small>

<!-- > -->

### Create an Express app

Add this to `server.js`:

```JS
// Create an express app
const app = express()
```

<small>(Standard Express.)</small>

<!-- > -->

Define a route. Use `graphqlHTTP` to handle requests to this route. 

```JS
// Define a route for GraphQL
app.use('/graphql', graphqlHTTP({
  schema,
  rootValue: root,
  graphiql: true
}))
```

In the `use` function above, we supplied the schema, the root resolver, and activated the GraphiQL browser for our app. 

<!-- > -->

Finally, start your app: 

```JS
// Start this app
const port = 4000
app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Running on port: ${port}`)
})
```

<small>(Standard Express app)</small>

<!-- > -->

### Test your work! 

- `npm start` run your app
- http://localhost:4000/graphql

This should open GraphiQL in your browser. 

GraphiQL allows us to test our GraphQL Queries. Its the same tool you used in the last class. 

<!-- > -->

### Try a query: 

```JS
{
  getAbout {
    message
  }
}
```

Compare this to the schema and the resolver:

- query type: `getAbout`
  - returns Type `About`
    - An `About` has a field `message` of type `String`

<!-- > -->

Let's follow this backwards. Starting with this query: 

```JS
{
  getAbout {
    message
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

GraphQL handles with a resolver: 

```JS
const root = {
  getAbout: () => {
    return { message: 'Hello World' }
  }
}
```

It returns an object with a `message` property that is type `String`. 

<!-- > -->

The Resolver checked this against the schema. 

```JS
type About {
  message: String!
}

type Query {
  getAbout: About
}
```

The `getAbout` query returns an `About` which always has a `message` of type `String`. 

<!-- > -->

## GraphQL Resolvers 

<!-- > -->

A resolver is responsible for resolving a query. Resolvers can be hierarchical and complicated. It's probably where most of your work will go when building a GraphQL system. 

![GraphiQL Interface Expanded](../assets/graphiql-expanded.png)

<!-- > -->

This is the **root resolver**. <br> It maps queries to the schema.

```JS
const root = {
  getAbout: () => {
    return { message: 'Hello World' }
  }
}
```

<small>(`getAbout` maps to the query type with the same name)</small>

<!-- > -->

Let's do it again from the top. 

<!-- > -->

Imagine you're making an API for yourself. Imagine a query is like asking you a question. The repsonse is like the answer you might provide. 

<!-- > -->

###Define a new type in your schema

If someone asks what to eat? You would reply with a meal type. 

```JS
type Meal {
	description: String!
}
```

<!-- > -->

**Add a query type to handle meal queries.** It will return a Meal.

```JS
type Query {
  getAbout: About
	getmeal: Meal
}
```

<!-- > -->

**Add a resolver function**. This function returns something that must match the Meal type (has description field of type string)

```JS
const root = {
  getAbout: () => {
    return { message: 'Hello World' }
  },
	getmeal: () => {
		return { description: 'Noodles' }
	}
}
```

<!-- > -->

Sometimes it takes some information to get some information. Often you'll need to provide parameters to the data that you need. 

<!-- > -->

Queries can take parameters. You saw this in SWAPI. You can add arguments to your queries. 

<!-- > -->

Imagine there is a different meal depending on the time: breakfast, lunch, or dinner. 

The Meal type will stay the same since it will still be a field description that is a string. 

<!-- > -->

**Modify the Query type to accept an argument. **

```JS
type Query {
  getAbout: About
	getmeal(time: String!): Meal
}
```

<small>(`getMeal` now takes an argument: `time`, of type `String` which is required)</small>

<!-- > -->

**Modify the resolver to work with this argument. **

```JS
const root = {
  getAbout: () => {
    return { message: 'Hello World' }
  },
	getmeal: ({ time }) => {
		const allMeals = { breakfast: 'toast', lunch: 'noodles', dinner: 'pizza' }
		const meal = allMeals[time]
		return { description: meal }
	}
}
```

<small>(The resolver receives an args object with all of the parmeters defined in the query type)</small>

<!-- > -->

**Test your query:**

```JS
{
  getmeal(time: "lunch") {
    description
  }
}
```

Should return:

```JSON
{
  "data": {
    "getmeal": {
      "description": "noodles"
    }
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

### Working with Collections

<!-- > -->

Often you'll want to work with collections. You more often have posts, or users, or foods. Less often you have a single post, user, or food.

<!-- > -->

Imagine you want to define a list of pets. You might start with a `Pet` type. 

```JS 
type Pet {
  name: String!
  species: String!
}
```

<!-- > -->

Imagine you have an array of pets. A query type might look like this: 

```JS
type Query {
  ...
  getPet(id: Int!): Pet # Add a query to get a single pet
  allPets: [Pet!]!      # Returns an array of type Pet
}
```

<!-- > -->

Now set up a resolver for each of the new queries. 

```JS 
const root = {
  ...
	getPet: ({ id }) => {	
		return petList[id]
	},
	allPets: () => {	
		return petList
	},
	...
}
```

<small>(`getPet(id)` takes the `id` and returns the pet at that index, `allPets` returns an array of all pets)</small>

<!-- > -->

Better define the `petList`! This could be defined by a database!

```JS
# Mock datatbase in this case:
const petList = [
	{ name: 'Fluffy', species: 'Dog' },
	{ name: 'Sassy', species: 'Cat' },
	{ name: 'Goldberg', species: 'Frog' }
]
```

<!-- > -->

Now write a query. Notice you can choose fields to fetch. 

```JS
{ # Get the names of all pets
  allPets {
    name
  }
}
```

```JS
{ # Get pet 2 species
  getPet(id: 2) {
    species
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

## Challenges 

<!-- > -->

Try these challenges. 

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 1**

Make a list of your pets, or a list of things: songs you wrote, favorite recipes, movies you've watched, anything really. 

Make a type for this thing with at least three fields. 

*Examples*:

- Pet: name, species, age
- Song: title, genre, length
- Movie: title, genre, rating

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 2** 

Make an array of the things with data for each. You should be able to get an array of things with a query like this:

```JS 
{
  Pets {
    name
  }
}
```

Should return the names of all Pets in the database

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 3**

1. Make a query type for your collection. 
1. Make a query that will return all of the things.
1. Make another query that will take the index of a thing as the argument and return 1 of the things.

```JS 
{
  Pet(id: 1) {
    name
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 4**

Test your work by writing a query in GraphiQL. 

Try writing a query for a several fields to make sure they return properly

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 5**

You need a server that returns the time. Write a type for the time. It should have properties for: 

- hour
- minute
- year

Write a resolver that gets the time and returns an object with the properties: hour, minute, year.

```JS
{
  getTime {
    hour
    year
    minute
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 6** 

Imagine we need the server to return a random random number. Your job is to write a resolve that makes the GraphQL quer below function: 

```JS
{
  getRandom(range: 100) 
}
```

Which should return: 

```JS
{
  "data": {
    "getRandom": 77
  }
}
```

<!-- > -->

**Challenge 7** 

Create a type that represents a die roll. It should take the number of dice and the number of sides on each die.

Below is an example query, and the response that should come back

**Example Query**

```JS 
{
  getRoll(sides:6, rolls: 3) {
    total, 
    sides,
    rolls
  }
}
```

**Example Response**

```JS
{
  total: 10, // total of all rolls (see below)
  sides: 6,  // each roll should be 1 to 6 based on the original sides parameter
  rolls: [5, 2, 3] // 3 rolls based on the original rools parameter (5+2+3=10)
}
```
