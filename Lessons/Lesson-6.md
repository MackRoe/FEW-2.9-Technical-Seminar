## GraphQL Subscriptions

<!-- > -->

Subscriptions represent a real time presistent connection to a GraphQL server.

Use them to send push notifications and real time updates to connected GraphQL clients.

<!-- > -->

GraphQL *doesn't* implement the code that backs up subscriptions. This is handled by the framework or library that implements the GraphQL Spec. For web based projects this is most often a websocket.

### Websockets

<!-- > -->

Websockets represent a persistent connection. Which is different from the standard call and response cycle we use most often.
